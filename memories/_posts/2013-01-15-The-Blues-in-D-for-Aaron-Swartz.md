My name is Peter Gayed. Like Aaron, I was born and raised in a Chicago
suburb. Like Aaron, I attended a prestigious school as part of my
education. (Unlike Aaron, however, I was not smart enough -- nor
courageous enough -- to leave school to set out my own tracks.)

Like Aaron, I know what it feels like to be soiled by federal
prosecutors in a 'criminal' charge and then be offered a number of
plea bargains.

Like Aaron, I also know what it feels like to refuse these plea
'bargains' and suffer the consequences -- consequences that weigh
heavily on my mother, my father, and my two younger brothers each and
every day.

But, like Aaron, I also believe I know the feeling that one cannot
accept the easiest 'way out' for oneself because there is much more
-- and many more people -- at stake. Many more people at stake than
Aaron or I could ever meet in a lifetime. Much more at stake than
Aaron or I could ever know.

Aaron was committed to a noble idea and, at times, noble ideas seem to
require 'ignoble' actions; what is clear, however, is that what is
noble and what is ignoble -- in action and in thought -- are left to
the eye of the beholder as well as to the mind of beholden.

Some people in this world act and think ignobly (usually in that
order); a far rarer kind think and act nobly (in that order, always).
Aaron, I believe, was of this second group, and so, too, must have
been his parents.

I wept when my mother brought me the Sunday Chicago Tribune, though I
never permit myself to do so in her presence. I will, however, allow
her to observe me mourn in song. I’m not much of a musician but I
composed 'The Blues in D for Aaron Swartz,' which I offer now to all
of Aaron’s friends and family. It is both a paean to and a lamentation
of his short but brilliant life.
